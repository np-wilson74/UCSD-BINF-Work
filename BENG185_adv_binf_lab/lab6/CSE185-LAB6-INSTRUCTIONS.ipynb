    "# Week 6 Lab: Don’t get lost in the crowd (scRNA-seq)\n",
    "\n",
    "Skills: scRNA-seq, t-SNE, using Python analysis packags\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Before single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq allowed the study of average expression level for each gene in a large population of cells. However, a limitation of bulk RNA-seq is that the method is insufficient for studying heterogenous systems such as early development or complex tissues like the brain. scRNA-seq measures the distribution of expression levels for each gene in a large population of cells which allows the study of cell-specific changes in the transcriptome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will analyze scRNA-seq data of brain cells from a mouse brain sample with the goal of identifying expression signatures of different brain cell types. The sample was taken from a mouse embryo at 18 days of development. The brain region sampled consists of multiple cell types, including cortex, hippocampus, and the sub-ventricular zone. 1,303 cells were sequenced with approximately 71,000 reads per cell using 10X Genomics single-cell technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll go through:\n",
    "1. Exploring data formats for single cell data\n",
    "2. Filtering poor-quality cells\n",
    "3. Visualizing the distribution of expressed genes across cells\n",
    "4. Identifying highly variable genes\n",
    "5. Performing PCA and t-SNE \n",
    "7. Performing differential expression analysis \n",

    "\n",
    "### Summary of tools covered\n",
    "In this lab we'll be using or referring to the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger): the 10X Genomics tool for processing scRNA-seq fastq files. This pipeline performs many different analyses, including some quality control, alignment, and quantification of gene expression in each cell.\n",
    "* [Scanpy](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy): a Python toolkit for scRNA-seq analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Summary of data provided\n",
    "Data for this week can be found in `/datasets/cs185-sp21-A00-public/week6`. You should see the following folders, which were all created by Cell Ranger:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `neuron_1k_v3_fastqs`: fastq files with raw reads\n",
    "* `alignment`: BAM file with aligned reads\n",
    "* `analysis`: analysis including dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, and differential expression\n",
    "* `filtered_feature_bc_matrix`: filtered feature-barcode matrices containing only cellular barcodes\n",
    "* `raw_feature_bc_matrix`: unfiltered feature-barcode matrices containing all barcodes\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see the folder `cellranger-3.0.2`, which contains the reference transcriptome for Cell Ranger if you choose to rerun the alignment + gene quantification yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "This lab involves a lot of exploratory analysis of the single cell data, which will require you to set some thresholds on your own. Not everyone will end up getting the same results, which is ok! But please make sure you at least justify what you did and clearly describe any thresholds you used or decisions you made in the Methods section."

    "## 1. Exploring data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, it is always a good idea to get some basic stats on the data you're dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at the raw fastq data, which you can find in the `neuron_1k_v3_fastqs` directory. You will see two sets of fastq files: `neuron_1k_v3_S1_L001*.fastq.gz` and `neuron_1k_v3_S1_L002*.fastq.gz`. The `L001` and `L002` just refer to two lanes of the Illumina flowcell. For each lane of data, you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `neuron_1k_v3_S1_L00X_R1_001.fastq.gz` (contains the barcode and UMI for each read)\n",
    "* `neuron_1k_v3_S1_L00X_R2_001.fastq.gz` (contains cDNA)\n",
    "* `neuron_1k_v3_S1_L00X_I1_001.fastq.gz` (contains the sample index for each read)\n",
    "\n",
    "(where `X` is either 1 or 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is paired end data, and the `R1` and `R2` files denote the two reads in each pair, just like we're used to seeing for paired-end genome sequencing data. For each lane we also get an \"index\" fastq (the `I1` file), which lists a bunch of short sequences denoting the \"index\" for each read. Index sequences are special identifiers added to DNA samples during library preparation and this allows multiple libraries to be pooled and sequenced together. After sequencing, reads are demultiplexed from their corresponding index sequences so we know which reads came from which library. (We won't really need to worry about the indices here since we're treating everything as one sample.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">**FOR YOUR REPORT (Methods-Q1)**</font> Summarize the datasets we are starting with: what type of data are we analyzing? Where did they come from? How many reads are there in each dataset, and what is the read length? How many different libraries were pooled together (you can get this by counting the number of unique index reads, but ignoring index sequences with very few counts since those are likely just due to sequencing errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we explored the raw data, the next step is to align the reads to a reference transcriptome, similar to what we did in Lab 4 on bulk RNA-sequencing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will introduce a tool, Cell Ranger from 10X Genomics, which can perform a wide variety of useful scRNA-seq analyses. For our analyses we'll be using the `cellranger count` pipeline. This pipeline takes in fastq files in the format we have above, and:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aligns reads to a reference transcriptome\n",
    "2. Performs basic QC including filtering and barcode/UMI counting\n",
    "3. Generates feature-barcode matrices\n",
    "4. Performs clustering\n",
    "5. Performs gene expression analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool can take several hours to run on the example dataset, so we have run this part for you using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cellranger count \\\n",
    "   --id=mouse_brain \\\n",
    "   --fastqs=/datasets/cs185s-sp19-public/week6/neuron_1k_v3_fastqs \\\n",
    "   --sample=neuron_1k_v3 \\\n",
    "   --transcriptome=cellranger-3.0.2/refdata-cellranger-mm10-3.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note: this may take around 3 hrs or more to run, which is why we have run it for you. Just use the output as is.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellranger performs alignment to the reference transcriptome (in this case, we used the mm10 reference genome) and outputs BAM files. You can use samtools to take a look at the alignment files. \n",
    "\n",
    "After alignment, Cell Ranger quantifies the number of reads coming from each gene in each cell. This is represented as a matrix, with each row (feature) corresponding to a gene and each column corresponding to a cell. Recall that individual cells are identified using barcodes. Cell Ranger names the output of these counts \"feature-barcode\" matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see two folders containing these matrices:\n",
    "* `raw_feature_bc_matrix`: contains data for all barcodes detected\n",
    "* `filtered_feature_bc_matrix`: contains data that has been filtered to remove barcodes corresponding to empty droplets that did not contain any cells (this occasionally happens). \n",
    "\n",
    "Including empty droplets would just make our matrix even more sparser than it already is, so we will focus only on the filtered data. Read more about how single cells are sequenced using GEM [here](https://community.10xgenomics.com/t5/10x-Blog/Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-An-Introductory-Overview-and-Tools-for/ba-p/547)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the filtered matrix directory you will find three files: \n",
    "* `matrix.mtx.gz`: the matrix represented in Matrix Market format, which is used to store sparse matrices (meaning most of the elements are zero)\n",
    "* `features.tsv.gz`: a list containing the gene name for each row of the matrix\n",
    "* `barcodes.tsv.gz`: a list containing the barcode for each column of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll through these files to make sure you understand the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">**FOR YOUR REPORT (Methods-Q2)**</font> Summarize the methods used to perform alignment and gene expression quantification. What cell ranger command was used? Which reference transcriptome? What were the inputs and outputs? Specify any non-default options. \n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the data formats, we're going to load the matrix to work with. For this task, we're going to use the python library Scanpy, a toolkit for scRNA-seq analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to install this library and some dependencies. You can install these locally by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install --upgrade --user pip # upgrade pip\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install scanpy and its dependencies\n",
    "pip install --user 'scanpy[leiden]'\n",
    "pip install --user --upgrade scikit-learn numba\n",
    "pip install --user --upgrade louvain\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test that the install finished successfully, try loading the library (as in the code below). Ask a friend or TA if this isn't working, since you will need to this for the rest of the lab.\n",

This is for several reasons: first, currently the most robust tools for scRNA-seq analysis are available only in Python (or R) libraries! And second, sometimes in the real world you'll be faced with a research task, and it might be that the only tool available for what you need requires you to write code in a specific language that you may or may not be comforable with (e.g., differential expression analysis tools typically require R). You don't need to be an expert in that language, but will need to figure out enough to wrangle the tool into doing what you want.\n",

    "## 3. Visualizing distribution of genes in cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice way of visualizing the distribution of some data is through violin plots. Violin plots are like box plots in the sense that they show medians, ranges and variabilities. However, box plots do not show the full distribution of the data. Violin plots show the probability density of the data at different values. The shape of the violin plot is just the distribution of the data plotted sideways on both sides of a box plot. Look [here](https://blog.bioturing.com/2018/05/16/5-reasons-you-should-use-a-violin-graph/) for a visualization of how violin plots can capture information about the data distribution that wouldn't be captured in a box plot.\n",

    "1. The number of genes expressed per cell.\n",
    "2. The percentage of genes for each cell that are mitochondrial.\n",
    "3. Total counts across cells. (here counts is the number of reads that have been mapped back to the transcriptome for each cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we plot these we need to compute them for each cell. AnnData objects contain an `obs` variable (e.g. `adata.obs`) which is just a data frame (like we've seen in `pandas`) with different information about each cell. For instance, `adata.obs[\"n_genes\"]` gives the number of genes found per cell. Type `adata.obs` to see the columns available.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4. Identifying highly variable genes\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our goal is to use scRNA-seq to identify different cell sub-types, we are most interested in genes that are differentially expressed across different cells. So we will want to restrict analysis to highly variable genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll need to do some normalization so we can compare expression across cells. Before normalization, the total reads derived from each cell may differ substantially. We will want to transform the data by dividing each column (cell) of the expression matrix by a “normalization factor,” an estimate of the library size relative to the other cells. It is also standard practice to log transform our data to decrease the variability of our data and transform skewed data to approximately conform to normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total-count normalize (library-size correct) the data matrix to 10,000 reads per cell, so that counts become comparable among cells. Then logarithmize the data. The code below shows how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sc.pp.normalize_per_cell(adata_filt, counts_per_cell_after=1e4) # normalize to 10,000 reads/cell\n",
    "sc.pp.log1p(adata_filt) # log transform\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **dispersion** to quantify the variability of each gene. Dispersion is a measure of how \"stretched\" or \"squeezed\" a distribution is and is typically computed as \"variance/mean\" (other metrics are sometimes used). Higher dispersion means higher variability. In Scanpy, genes are first binned based on mean expression levels. Normalized dispersion for each gene is then computed as the absolute difference between the gene's dispersion and the median dispersion of genes in that bin, divided by the median deviation within each bin. This means that for each bin of mean expression, highly variable genes are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scanpy function `highly_variable_genes` (see [here](https://icb-scanpy.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/stable/api/scanpy.api.pp.highly_variable_genes.html)) is useful for finding genes with highest dispersion. e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "We will perform two clustering methods, PCA and TSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) analysis on our dataset. Both methods are ways to look at variation in our data, however, PCA is more suitable for bulk RNA-seq data while t-SNE is used more for scRNA-seq data since it is better at dealing with sparse matrices. Refer to lab 3 for details on PCA and refer to Wednesday lecture slides for details on t-SNE.\n",
