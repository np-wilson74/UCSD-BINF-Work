Throughout the lab assignments, we will be switching back and forth between the terminal (where you will run command line tools to perform data analysis) and Jupyter notebooks (where you will complete the assignments and visualize your analysis results).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the terminal in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the upper right corner of the main Jupyter page (the one that led you to this notebook), click \"New\" then choose \"Terminal\". This will open a new window with a terminal screen.\n",
    "* Alternatively, edit your URL to be https://datahub.ucsd.edu/user/yourusername/lab (rather than /tree) to enter the JupyterLab environment. In the Launcher you should see an option to choose \"Terminal\". JupyterLab is also convenient for viewing the directory structure and files that are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these will launch a terminal and put you in your home directory. Use `pwd` to print the current working directory:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",

    "Besides your home directory, the other directory you need to know about is the `/datasets/cs185-sp21-A00-public/` directory which contains all datasets that will be needed for the assignments. To get to this directory, you use the `cd` (change directory) command. The general format for this command is:\n",

    "cd [directory]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the command, replace the part in brackets with the path to the directory that you’d like to change too. (We will use a similar format throughout the tutorials for code you will need to fill in.) This path can be absolute or relative. If you just type `cd` alone, the shell will take you to your home directory. To specify relative paths in the [directory] part of the command, a single period refers to the current directory and a double period refers to its parent.\n",
