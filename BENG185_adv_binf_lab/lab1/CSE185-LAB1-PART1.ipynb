    "### Intro\n",
    "A patient arrives in your clinic with a rare disorder. You expect the condition is genetic (i.e. due to a mutation in her genome). However since the condition is not observed in any family members, you suspect it could be due to a *de novo* mutation that occurred in the germline (egg or sperm cells) of one of her parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "To look for potential disease-causing mutations, you perform whole genome sequencing on the patient and her parents (which together we call a \"trio\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will learn some key basics for processing next generation sequencing (NGS) data, including sequence alignment, variant calling, and standard file formats (FASTQ/BAM/VCF). For this week's assignment, many commands and template code are provided to you. In future labs, you'll be doing more of this set up on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll get familiar with the datasets and align our reads to the reference genome. In part 2, we'll dive deeper and go look for candidate mutations."

    "Before running any analysis, it's a good practice to look manually at the data to make sure all the files are what you think they are. First, you should look at the sequence files to verify the format is correct. You don’t want to open the entire files, you will just do a quick inspection of the first few reads. Use the `head` command to look at the first 20 lines in the first fastq file for the child genome (`NA12878_child_1.fq`). Replace [file.format] below with the actual path to this file. Recall from the exercises that the data files specific to this week's assignment can be found in the `/datasets/cs185-sp21-A00-public/week1` directory.\n",

    "this read. The next line contains the actual sequence, then on line three there is a \"+\", which may\n",
    "sometimes have the identifier and info repeated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Line 4 contains the quality string, where ASCII characters encode the quality score for each base.\n",
    "The quality score ranges from 0 to about 40; the higher the number, the greater the confidence of the\n",
    "base call. To get the actual quality score, you need to figure out the value of the symbol, then subtract\n",
    "33 (this is called \"Sanger\" scaling type, because it's the same scaling that people use with traditional\n",
    "sanger sequencing). With some older Illumina data (pre version 1.8), you subtract other numbers, like\n",

Notice the reads are in the same order in each file. e.g. the first reads in `NA12878_child_1.fq` and in `NA12878_child_2.fq` are paired. They have identical read identifiers, with the exception of the suffix `<read id>/1` vs. `<read id>/2`."

    "\n",
    "To make sense out of these small sequences of DNA, we will map them to our reference sequence. Mapping works by taking each read and trying to find the closest matching sequence in the reference genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many alignment programs (\"aligners\") available. The earliest alignment algorithms (Smith Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch) are still used today to compare small pieces of DNA one-by-one, but the computing power needed to map millions of short reads to genomes that are millions to billions of basepairs long requires special algorithms to speed up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use an aligner called BWA-MEM, which makes use of the Burrows-Wheeler transform for reversible data compression (the reference is summarized with a special reversible index, the index makes it faster to search). BWA-MEM is optimized for ‘long’ next-generation sequencing reads of 100bp or more, which may contain several mutations, insertions, or deletions, as it works by finding the ‘maximum exact match’ within a read to the reference, rather than forcing the entire read to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to index the reference file. This step takes a while, so **it has already been done for you**. We created the BWA-MEM index by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bwa index hg19.fa # don't run this!\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "ls /datasets/cs185-sp21-A00-public/genomes/hg19.fa*\n",
    "```\n",
